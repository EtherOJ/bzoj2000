What about all the things that you said was yours and mine.
Did you ever stop to notice.
All the blood we've shed before. All the children dead from war.
Do we give a damn. Someone tell me why.
God is a girl. Wherever you are.
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
When you've found that special thing, you're flying without wings.
One hour today is worth two tomorrow.
If you run after two hares, you will catch neither.
