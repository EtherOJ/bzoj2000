What about sunrise. What about rain.
What about all the things that you said we were to gain.
What about killing fields.
Is there a time.
What about all the things that you said was yours and mine.
Did you ever stop to notice?
All the blood we've shed before.
All the children dead from war.
Do we give a damn?
Someone tell me why.
