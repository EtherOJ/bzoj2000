Do you want any meat today. Mrs. Bird?
Do you want beef or lamb?
This lamb's very good.
I like lamb, but my husband doesn't.
God is a girl.
God is a girl.Wherever you are.
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
She's only a girl.
She wants to shine forever in time.
There is a rainbow for you and me.
