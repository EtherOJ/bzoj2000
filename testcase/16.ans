Remembering me, discover and see. all over the world, she is known as a girl.
To those who are free, the mind shall be key, forgotten as the past, cause history will last.
God is a girl.
God is a girl wherever you are.
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
She's only a girl.
She wants to shine forever in time.
There is a rainbow for you and me.
However you live.
Someone is out there that we truly trust.
